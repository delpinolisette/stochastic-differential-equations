# Stochastic Differential Equations Cheatsheet

All important topics from SDEs (at least in my opinion)

This is a topic I've "approached from the side" by accident often when studying Measure Theory, Real Analysis, and Probability. SDEs have a ton of applications and they're super interesting so I wanted to work on a public cheatsheet!

I have also added basic examples for some definitions, lemmas, and theorems. 

## Important Problem Prototypes 

### Stochastic DEs

$\frac{dN}{dt} = \alpha(t)N(t)$ with $N(0) = N_0$

where $N_0$ is a constant.

Issue: $\alpha(t) = r(t) + \omega$
$\omega$ is undetermined noise, $r(t)$ nonrandom. 

How do we solve this DE?

## Sigma algebra definition

$\Omega$ is some set. (Say $\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$)

$\mathcal{F}$ is a **family** of subsets of $\Omega$ ([See family vs. collection](https://www.samuel-drapeau.info/math/2015/10/04/family-vs-collection/#:~:text=Typical%20examples%20of%20families%20are,ten%20times%20the%20number%201.))

$\sigma$-algebra is $\mathcal{F}$, a family of subsets of $\Omega$, such that these conditions hold:

**A**. $$\empty \in \mathcal{F}$$

**B**. The complement of any subset belonging to $\mathcal{F} \in \mathcal{F}$ (so, $F \in \mathcal{F} \implies F^C \in \mathcal{F}$, where $F^c := \Omega / F$

**C**. $$A_1, A_2, \dots \in \mathcal{F} \implies A:= \bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} A_i \in \mathcal{F}$$ (the union of all subsets in $\mathcal{F}$ is in $\mathcal{F}$)

*A sigma algebra of the subsets of any set seems to me to be an intuitive way of making sure your subsets, their complements, and their "closures" are all accounted for*
