# Stochastic Differential Equations Cheatsheet

All important topics from SDEs (at least in my opinion)

This is a topic I've "approached from the side" by accident often when studying Measure Theory, Real Analysis, and Probability. SDEs have a ton of applications and they're super interesting so I wanted to work on a public cheatsheet!

I have also added basic examples for some definitions, lemmas, and theorems.

### Stochastic DEs

$\frac{dN}{dt} = \alpha(t)N(t)$ with $N(0) = N_0$

where $N_0$ is a constant.

Issue: $\alpha(t) = r(t) + \omega$
$\omega$ is undetermined noise, $r(t)$ nonrandom. 

How do we solve this DE?
